I'm Baptiste Imbert (he/him), a computational biologist. I'm interested in improving people's lives in an environmentally friendly way. That is why I studied human genomics and genetics before switching to plants, which is just another approach to tackle the same broad goal ("One Health"). More specifically, I like to understand how the genetic program of cells work to find out what can be modified, corrected or optimized. To do this, my research focuses on data analysis (genomics, transcriptomics, genetic variants) and data integration (NoSQL database, ontologies), whenever possible using bioinformatics pipelines for reproducible research.
