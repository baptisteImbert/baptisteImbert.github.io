I'm Baptiste Imbert (he/him), a computational biologist. I'm interested in improving people's lives in an environmentally friendly way. That is why I studied human genomics and genetics before switching to plants, which is just another approach to tackle the same broad goal. More precisely, I like understanding how the genetic programm of cells to figure out what can be modified, corrected or optimized. To do this, my research focuses on data analysis (genomics, transcriptomics, genetic variants) and data integration (NoSQL database, ontologies), whenever possible using bioinformatics pipelines for reproducible research.
