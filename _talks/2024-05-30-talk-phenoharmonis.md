An inconsistent vocabulary of available metadata is often a major barrier for data integration and comparison. Indeed, research groups sometimes use different terms to refer to similar entities and processes. The Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable (FAIR) principles rely heavily on ontologies, which define and hierarchically organise the vocabulary of a given domain of knowledge to achieve machine-readable metadata and semantically link related datasets. Here, we show how we decided to take advantage of existing Planteome ontologies to insert genetic and -omic data from grain legumes into a Neo4j Knowledge Graph framework, Ortho_KB. Grain legumes, also known as pulses, are essential for providing high-quality plant-based protein, meeting the challenge of a growing world population and promoting One Health. Although diverse, grain legume species are closely related and share many similarities, including their global physiology and the range of limiting factors that can affect their yield. Using the Plant Ontology, the Plant Trait Ontology and the Plant Experimental Conditions Ontology, we are able to annotate genetic information and gene expression related metadata prior to integration into the knowledge graph. Through translational research, the increasing amount of data available can be used to transfer knowledge across species and accelerate crop improvement. For example, users can highlight the conservation of genetic determinants across studies and species. They can also explore and compare gene expression profiles using data from different sources.
